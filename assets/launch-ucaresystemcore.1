.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a launcher script for uCareSystem Core that provides a graphical way to start the application.

The launcher automatically detects the default terminal emulator on the system using the update-alternatives system.
It then opens the terminal and executes \fBucaresystem-core\fR with proper error handling and user interaction.

The script includes fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility across different Linux distributions and desktop environments.
After \fBucaresystem-core\fR completes, it prompts the user to press Enter before closing the terminal window.

This launcher is typically used by desktop environments through the .desktop file or GUI applications.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The launcher exits with status 0 on success, or 1 if no suitable terminal emulator is found.

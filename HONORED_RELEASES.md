## Instructions for Maintainers

When creating a new release:

1. Update the `UCARE_VERSION` in `src/ucaresystem-core`
2. Update the `VER_CODENAME` to honor a new supporter/contributor
3. Update the `PREV_VER` to the previous version number
4. Add a new entry to this file with the release details
5. Update the `SUPPORTERS` array in the script if needed

## Guidelines for Honoring Contributors

- Each release should honor a different person when possible
- Priority should be given to financial supporters and significant contributors
- Names should be used with permission from the individuals
- Try to avoid repeating names across releases to honor more people over time
